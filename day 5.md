# Routing and design rule checking
## Introduction to maze routing lee algorithm
- Maze routing = Lee's algorithm
- routing = connecting 2 points with shortest path (try to have L shaped paths, minimize zigzag)

algorithm:
- algorithm creates grid (has standard dimensions)
- creates 2 points -> source (S) and target (T)
- labels obstructions such as the pre-placed (need to avoid these places when routing)

- starts by labelling the horizontal and vertical adjacent to source as 1, and then expands similarly with each step incremeting number until it reaches target

## Leeâ€™s Algorithm conclusion
- the algorithm follows the cell numbers and chooses the path with minimum bends in order to make the shortest path

- for photolithography to work, wire width needs to be at least a minimum

- pitch = distance between centers -> optimized photolithography process (which distance prints best)

- minimum distance between wires

- short occurs when wires on same layer overlap -> functionality failure
- can be solved by moving one of the wire to a different layer

- new rules to check: minimum wire width and minimum spacing
